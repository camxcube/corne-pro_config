## Disable Battery Reporting Service
## On macOS the BLE battery reporting packets can cause the computer to wakeup from sleep.
## To prevent this, the battery reporting service can be disabled by setting `CONFIG_BT_BAS=n`.
## This setting is independent of battery monitoring, for instance the battery level can still be indicated on a display.
CONFIG_BT_BAS=n
